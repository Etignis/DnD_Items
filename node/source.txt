This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch,
which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a
hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or
smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in

ARMOR OF VULNERABILITY
Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one
of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing,
or slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines
it randomly.
Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed
only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you
attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you
are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic:
removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed
you have vulnerability to two of the three damage type
associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants
resistance).
ARROW-CATCHING SHIELD
Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while

shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an
attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within
5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the
target of the attack instead.
ARROW OF SLAYING
Weapon (arrow), very rare
An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay
a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused
than others; for example, there are both arrows of
dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a
creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated
with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow,
the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving
throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed
save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.
Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a
creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.
Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist,
such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though
arrows are most common.
BAG OF BEANS
Wondrous item, rare
Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The
bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean
it contains.
If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they
explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans.
Each creature in the area, including you, must make a
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that
aren't being worn or carried.
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or
sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect
1 minute later from the ground where it was planted.
The DM can choose an effect from the following table,
determine it randomly, or create an effect.
BAG OF DEVOURING
Wondrous item, very rare
This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a
feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature.
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
The extradimensional creature attached to the bag
can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or
vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured
and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed
in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it,
there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled
inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its
action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength
check. Another creature can use its action to reach into
the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful
DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the
bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag
is devoured, its body destroyed.
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once
each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and
spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM
determines the time and plane.
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and
anything contained within it is transported to a random
location on the Astral Plane.
BAG OF HOLDING
Wondrous item, uncommon
This bag has an interior space considerably larger
than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter
at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to
500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents.
Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures
and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the
Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents
spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right
before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside
the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal
to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1
minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional
space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable
hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it
to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
BAG OF TRICKS
Wondrous item, uncommon
This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth,
appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however,
reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag
weighs 1/2 pound.
You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the
bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands,
it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling
a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the
bag's color. See the Monster Manual for the creature's
statistics.
The creature is friendly to you and your companions,
and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to
command how the creature moves and what action it
takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such
as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders,
the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the
bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.
BEAD OF FORCE
Wondrous item, rare
This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads
of force are found together.
You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60
feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed.
Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead
landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent
force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature
that failed the save and is completely within the area is
trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded
on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed
away from the center of the sphere until they are no
longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through
the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.
An enclosed creature can use its action to push
against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half
the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked
up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound,
regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

effect on you.

The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant
strength look different, but they have the same effect.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are
attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum
increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed,
you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within
reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack
rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is
within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the
axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15
Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you
must use your action each round to attack the creature
nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra
attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra
attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after
you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible
targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until
you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of
you that you can see or hear.

a long rest.

a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of
1 minute from the candle's total burn time.
While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot
radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment
matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving
throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a
cleric or druid in the light whose a lignment matches the
candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared
without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is
as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime
of opening.
Each creature in the area where the fortress appears
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking
lOdlO bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one. In either case,
the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside
but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't
being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed
automatically.
The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic
prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door,
and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to
damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege
weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a
wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell

regain 50 hit points.

the air and speak the command word. When you do so,

damage rolls.

of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause

DECK OF ILLUSIONS
Wondrous item, uncommon
This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full

drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing
cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to
draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the
ground at a point within 30 feet of you.
An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the
thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory
creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and
behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the
Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While
you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and
can see it, you can use an action to move it magically
anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical
interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an
illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who
uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies
it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. The creature then appears
translucent.
The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion
is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its
card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

HELM OF BRILLIANCE
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10
rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried
from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are
removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.
You gain the following benefits while wearing it:
You can use an action to cast one of the following
spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of
the specified type as a component: daylight (opal),
fireball (fi re opal), prismatic spray (diamond), or wall
of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is
cast and disappears from the helm.
As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits
dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead
is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in
that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.
As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have
resistance to fire damage.
As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can
use an action and speak a command word to cause
one weapon you are holding to burst into flames.
The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and
dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are
harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with
an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes
an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you
use a bonus action to speak the command word again
or until you drop or stow the weapon.
Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire
damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a
spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from
its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the
helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant
damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The
helm and its gems are then destroyed.

the comprehend languages spell from it at will.
HELM OF TELEPATHY

the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as
you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a
bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature
you are focused on. It can reply-using a bonus action to
do so- while your focus on it continues.
While focusing on a creature with detect thoughts,

DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used,
the suggestion property can't be used again until the
next dawn.
HELM OF TELEPORTATION

HEWARD'S HANDY HAVERSACK
Wondrous item, rare
This backpack has a central pouch and two side
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space.
Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material,
not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large
central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds
of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds,
regardless of its contents.
Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal
rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item
from the haversack requires you to use an action. When
you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item
is always magically on top.
The haversack has a few limitations. If it is
overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the
haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack
is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although
an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the
haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth,
unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before
it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed
within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to
10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.
Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional
space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or
similar item instantly destroys both items and opens
a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where
the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature
within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and
deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.
The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can·I
be reopened.

Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by
a paladin)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an
undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10
radiant damage.
While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura
in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures
friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects. If you
have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius o:
the aura increases to 30 feet.
HORN OF BLASTING
Wondrous item, rare
You can use an action to speak the horn's command
word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderou
blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away.
Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
ra kes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made
of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving
throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.
Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance
of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals
10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
HORN OF VALHALLA
Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze),
or legendary (iron)
You can use an action to blow this horn. In response,
warrior spirits from the plane ofYsgard appear within
60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics
'rom the Monster Manual. They return to Ysgard after 1
hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the
horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each
made of a different metal. The horn's type determines
how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as
£he requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's
rype or determines it randomly.
If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement,
the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet
the requirement, they are friendly to you and your
companions and follow your commands.
HORSESHOES OF A ZEPHYR
Wondrous item, very rare
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all
four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar
creature, they allow the creature to move normally
while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect
means the cre.ature can cross or stand above nonsolid
or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The
creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In
addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up
to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a
forced march.
HORSESHOES OF SPEED
Wondrous item, rare
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all
four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar
creature, they increase the creature's walking speed
by 30 feet.
IMMOVABLE ROD
Rod, uncommon
This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use
an action to press the button, which causes the rod to
become magically fixed in place. Until you or another
creature uses an action to push the button again, the
rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod
can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight
causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use
an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the
fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.
INSTRUMENT OF THE BARDS
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a
bard)
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of it
kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way.
Seven types of these instruments exist, each named
after a legendary bard college. The following table lists
the spells common to all instruments, as well as the
spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that
attempts to play the instrument without being attuned
to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
take 2d4 psychic damage.
You can use an action to play the instrument and cast
one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to
cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until
the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability
and spell save DC.
When you use the instrument to cast a spell that
causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the
targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This
effect applies whether you are using the instrument as
the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.
lOUN STONE
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)
An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge
and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of
Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of
shape and color.
When you use an action to toss one of these stones
into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance
of ld3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter,
another creature must use an action to grasp or net
the stone to separate it from you, either by making a
successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC
24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action
to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.
A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all
damage. It is considered to be an object that is being
worn while it orbits your head.
Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to
cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you
can see and targeting only you.
Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't
cancel it.
Agility(Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by
2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits
your head.
Awareness (Rare). You can't be surprised while this
dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink
rhomboid orbits your head.
Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled
lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can
use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower
cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.
Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't
cancel it.
Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom score increases
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue
sphere orbits your head.
Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled
scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.
Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma score
increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled
pink and green sphere orbits your head.
Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus
increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits
your head.
Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while
this dusty rose prism orbits your head.
Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 hit points
at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits
your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.
Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The
stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time.
When found, it contains ld4 - 1 levels of stored spells
chosen by the DM.
Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The
s pell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone.
If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended
without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell
determines how much space it uses.
While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any
spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save
DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the
original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the
spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in
it, freeing up space.
Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid
orbits your head.
Sustenance (Rare). You don't need to eat or drink
while this clear spindle orbits your head.
IRON BANDS OF BILARRO
Wondrous item, rare
This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter
and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak
the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or
smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As
the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle
of metal bands.
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal
to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus.
On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus
action to speak the command word again to release it.
Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands
to contract and become a sphere once more.
A creature, including the one restrained, can use an
action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the
iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and
the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any
further attempts made by that creature automatically
fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
Once the bands are used, they can't be used again
until the next dawn.
IRON FLASK
Wondrous item, legendary
This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an
action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the
target is native to a plane of existence other than the one
you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has
been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the
saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the
flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature
at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.
You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper
and release the creature the flask contains. The creature
is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and
obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no
commands or give it a command that is likely to result
in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no
actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in
accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside
the flask, but the only way to determine the type of
creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle
might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or
determined randomly.
JAVELIN OF LIGHTNING
Weapon (javelin), uncommon
This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and
speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of
lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out
from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in
the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on
a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful
one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when
it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack
against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage
from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.

as a magic weapon.

30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action
it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an
effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it

necessary to make a particular type of golem. The DM

MIRROR OF LIFE TRAPPING
Wondrous item, very rare
When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its
surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror
weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and
vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is
destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you
are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its
command word and activate it. It remains activated until
you use an action to speak the command word again.
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection
in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must
succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be
trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in
one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature
knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on
the saving throw automatically.
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled
with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures
trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't
need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within
a cell can escape using magic that permits planar
travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell
until freed.
If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve
extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror
frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate
the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an
unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing
away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures
it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied
spaces near it.
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an
action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or
call out a particular cell by number. The creature named
or contained in the named cell appears as an image
on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then
communicate normally.
In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a
second command word and free one creature trapped
in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with
its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the
mirror and facing away from it.
MITHRAL ARMOR
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt

NECKLACE OF A DAPTATION
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

and the breath weapons of some dragons).
NECKLACE OF FIREBALLS
Wondrous item, rare
This necklace has ld6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You
can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 6
feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the
bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15

necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the
level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
NECKLACE OF PRAYER BEADS
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric,
druid, or paladin)
This necklace has ld4 + 2 magic beads made from
aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber,
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a
magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead
loses its magic.
Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it
randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of
the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the
necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast
from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a
save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast,
that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.
NINE LIVES STEALER
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with this magic weapon.
The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical
hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points,
it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its
body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword
loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword
has no charges remaining, it loses this property.
NOLZUR'S MARVELOUS PIGMENTS
Wondrous item, very rare
Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box
with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments
allow you to create three-dimensional objects by
painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from
the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate
on its image.
Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square
feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects
or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees,
cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic
feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.
When you complete the painting, the object or terrain
feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object.
Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door
that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit
on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against
the total area of objects you create.
Nothing created by the pigments can have a value
greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value
(such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks
authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from
paste, bone, or some other worthless material.
If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning,
the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you
complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.
0ATHBOW
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in
Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a
command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have
wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your
sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later.
You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time.
When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new
one after the next dawn.
When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon
against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the
roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover,
other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage
due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy
takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.
While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage
on attack rolls with all other weapons.
OIL OF ETHEREALNESS
Potion, rare
Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its
container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a
Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment
it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required
for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil
takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the
effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.
OIL OF SHARPNESS

PIPES OF HAUNTING
Wondrous item, uncommon
PiPES OF THE SEWERS
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use

to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie,
spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you
that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute.
If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile
toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw.
A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw
is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The
pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
PIPES OF THE SEWERS
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use
these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary
rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will
not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as
an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to
3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats (see the
Monster Manual for statistics) with each expended
charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile
of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by
the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm,
the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the
music by the shortest available route but aren't under
your control otherwise. The pipes regain ld3 expended
charges daily at dawn.
Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another
creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you
are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check
contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose
the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would
and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next
24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed
by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and
your companions for as long as you continue to play the
pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys
your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly
swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions.
If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the
pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and
the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be
swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

PORTABLE HOLE
Wondrous item, rare
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular
sheet 6 feet in diameter.
You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and
place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the
portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10
feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists
on a different plane, so it can't be u ed to create open
passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can
exit the hole by climbing out of it.
You can use an action to close a portable hole by
taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.
Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or
objects within remain in the extradimensional space. o
matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.
If the hole is folded up, a creature with in the hole's
extradimensional space can use an action to make
a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the
creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of
the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing
creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up
to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.
Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional
space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy
haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any

and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.
The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't
be reopened.

RoD OF ABSORPTION
Rod, very rare (requires attunement)

absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an

and the spell's energy- not the spell itself- is stored in
the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when
it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels
of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod
absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you
are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod
has no effect on that spell.
When you become attuned to the rod, you know how
many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the
course of its existence, and how many levels of spell
energy it currently has stored.
If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells
you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots
only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell
slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored
levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell
as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in
the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb
spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes
